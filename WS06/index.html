            <h2>Introduction to different classes.</h2>
            <p>Motorcycles come in a variety of styles, each designed for different riding experiences. <strong>Cruisers</strong>, like the iconic Harley-Davidson, 
                offer a laid-back riding position and classic styling, perfect for long, relaxed rides. <strong>Sport</strong> bikes, such as those from Kawasaki and Yamaha
                , are built for speed and agility, featuring aerodynamic designs and powerful engines, ideal for track days and twisty roads.  
                <strong>Adventure</strong> bikes, such as the BMW GS series, blend on-road capability with off-road versatility, making them perfect for exploring diverse 
                terrains. Finally, <strong>Dirt</strong> bikes are lightweight and rugged, designed for tackling trails and rough terrain. Each type caters to different 
                preferences and riding styles, ensuring there's a motorcycle for everyone.</p>
